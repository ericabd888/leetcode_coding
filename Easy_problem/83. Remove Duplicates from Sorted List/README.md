# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

**Example 1:**<br>

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**<br>
<img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32319856/165881201-6f10e68f-c780-4c46-bebc-4526a0254485.png width=300>
```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

**IDEAs:**

**C++:**
```cpp
class Solution{

}
```
